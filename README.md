I‚Äôm a data scientist who is passionate in helping others make data driven decisions. I hold a Bsc degree in Mathematics and Statistics from Imperial College London, and  a Msc degree in Computer Science from University of Warwick. I also have 3+ years of experience working as a data analyst in the investment industry. When not digging through data for insights, you can find me either tutoring mathematics, or staying up to date with the latest and greatest PC hardware.\

### [Project 1: Predicting Credit Card Applications - Supervised Machine Learning](https://github.com/Qalif-R/Predicting_Credit_Card_Applications)
Commercial banks have the task of deciding whether or not credit card applications are successful or not. The teams in charge have to make a judgement call based on the profile of the applicant. Applicants may be rejected for a variety of reasons; high loan balances, low income level and poor credit history are some of the typical reasons application are unsuccessful. Traditionally, these applications are reviewed manually, in a case-by-case fashion. 

Here, we will train a **(supervised) machine learning classifier** to predict the outcome of applications - eliminating the time-consuming process of manual reviews.

### [Project 2: Forecasting Product Sales using ARIMA Time Series - Time Series Analysis](https://github.com/Qalif-R/ARIMA_Time_Series_Analysis)
Forecasting sales figures is an important part of any business. It allows businesses to optimize processes such as resource allocation, hiring of staff and inventory management to name a few. Having reliable sales forecast enables leaders to make data driven decisions which will impact the longevity of the business.

The task is to forecast shampoo sales. We are given 3 years worth of monthly sales (in units sold) of this particular product. We implement an **ARIMA Time Series Model**, which is a one of the most popular model in the field of time series analysis.

### [Project 3: Analysing AB Test Results - Hypothesis Testing](https://github.com/Qalif-R/AB_Test_Analysis)

An A/B Test is a randomized experiment in which a two or more variants a variable are deployed to different segments of customers to determine which of the version is most effective in boosting KPIs. 

For this case, we will be analysing the A/B test results data of an (ficticious) online learning platform called MindMapers. MindMappers operates on a freemium model, some of its courses are free, but the advanced courses are locked behind a paywall. MindMappers provides a 2 week trial for its advanced courses. At the end of the trial period, users are directed to a paywall. Two paywall variants with differing headlines were compared in this A/B test. We'll conduct a **statistical hypothesis test** to evaluate if an alternative paywall headline is worth implementing.

### [Project 4: Churn Analysis: Understanding Why Customers Leave - Interactive Dashboard](https://github.com/Qalif-R/Churn-Analysis)
Delta Co is a small (fictitious) mobile service provider operating in the United States.
The goal is to analyse data of Delta Co customers, and provide key information and insights on **how the organization can effectively reduce its churn rate**.
The data set used for this analysis provides profiles of  individual customers of Delta Co, and all insights are presented using a Power BI dashboard style report.

### [Project 5: Inventory Analysis: Tracking Sales Performance - Interactive Dashboard](https://github.com/Qalif-R/Inventory_Analysis)
Hammerhead hardware (HH) is a (fictitious) general accessories store with a global presence. Management of HH has requested for our advice on possible **improvements in inventory management and purchases**.
This dashboard tracks the year to date sales of all items sold by Hammerhead Hardware, as well as inventory levels in their warehouse located in New Jersey, USA. We will introduced some metrics which HH can use to determine the products to prioritise in the next stock replenishment cycle.
